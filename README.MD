# Audios-to-Twitter

This is a simple program that allows you to post audios to Twitter through a bot in Telegram. This program is intended to run on a computer or a Raspberry Pi. The main advantages over just posting a black video covering your phone's camera is that you can post audios directly from the computer and that both you and the people who listen to your audios use less data.
